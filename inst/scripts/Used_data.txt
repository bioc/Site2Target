Human in-vitro "Cardiomyocyte Progenitor Cells" at day 5 was used to exhibit regulatory functions that one can use with Site2Target.

All the used datasets are available as follow from:
 * ChIP-seq for MEIS1						E-MTAB-14243
 * RNA-seq wild-type vs MEIS KO cardiac differentiation		E-MTAB-14250
 * HiC interactions						GSM3262960

As the data for Bioconductor packages must be small. Only Chr21 of all the datasets have been used in Site2Target
