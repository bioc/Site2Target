Description: Statistics implemented for both peak-wise and gene-wise associations. In peak-wise associations, the p-value of the target genes of a given set of peaks are calculated. Negative binomial or Poisson distributions can be used for modeling the unweighted peaks targets and log-nromal can be used to model the weighted peaks. In gene-wise associations a table consisting of a set of genes, mapped to specific peaks, is generated using the given rules.
